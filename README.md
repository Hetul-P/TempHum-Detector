This is a for fun side project. I saw that I had a couple of unused things from my Arduino starter kit and so I decided to try something new. The readings are faily accurate but I would not use this as a day to day device as there probably are much better sensors out there. In order to make it mobile you can attach a battery to it so you can take it to various rooms and check their humidity.
